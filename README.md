# Penguin-Random-House-Rest-Api

Hello Guys,
This is a simple Java application using SPRING BOOT which enables to search authors by first name and last name. 
The parameters were taken randomly by a random search and I have used POSTMAN API Client.

The REST API for author search is https://reststop.randomhouse.com/resources/authors, 
Parameter names for search are firstName and lastName correspondingly for author's first name and last name.
